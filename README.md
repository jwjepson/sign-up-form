## Project Description: 
- The goal of this project was to create a sign up form for an imaginary service, as apart of the Odin Project curriculum. The instructions were to create a form completely from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, from a design image that the Odin Project provided. This form will not be connected to a backend, and therefore will not submit the data anywhere. The goal is to simply learn how to create, design, and lastly validate user submitted data (client side).

## What I've learned:
- Continued to learn how to use flexbox to achieve the layout in the design file.
- How to structure forms in HTML using labels and input tags.
- Using the appropriate input type for the data that is being asked for.
- Improving knowledge of the difference between "GET" and "POST" methods on forms, and when to use either one of them. 
- More practice using psuedo classes (:hover, :focus, :invalid), and child combinators to target specific HTML elements.
- How to link a submit button outside of the form tag, using the attribute "form".
- Using Javascript to validate user input, before the form is submitted. 
- Using pattern matching to validate user input.


## Final Thoughts:
Overall, this project was good practice continuing to practice laying out my webpage according to the design image. It was challenging at first, but I decided I would approach it section by section at a time. I have had previous experience creating forms, in CS50, so creating the form was relatively easy for me. I really enjoyed using Javascript to validate that the passwords matched, and then displaying an error message if they didn't. I found that approach to be better design than using :invalid, and by default having the password fields say "Passwords do not match", because it was a required field and nothing was typed in yet. Better to wait for the user to give input, before giving an error message. Overall, this project was really fun and it helped cement my knowledge of creating forms.
